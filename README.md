# Google Meet Auto-Joiner

## üöÄ Overview

The **Google Meet Auto-Joiner** is a user-friendly desktop application designed to automate the process of joining and leaving Google Meet classes. If you find yourself forgetting to join online classes or want to ensure you're never marked absent, this tool is for you.

It provides a clean graphical user interface (UI) to manage a weekly schedule of your classes. Once set, the application runs quietly in the background, automatically opening your Google Meet links at the specified times, muting your microphone and camera, joining the call, and then closing the tab when the class duration is over.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The application uses the `tkinter` library for its user interface. The `schedule` library is used to manage the timing of the jobs. When a scheduled time arrives, the `pyautogui` library takes control of the mouse and keyboard to perform the following actions:

1.  Opens the specified Google Meet URL in a new browser tab.
2.  Waits for the page to load.
3.  Presses the keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+D` and `Ctrl+E` or `Cmd+D` and `Cmd+E`) to mute the microphone and disable the camera.
4.  Locates the `join_button.png` on the screen and clicks it.
5.  After the specified duration, it presses `Ctrl+W` (or `Cmd+W`) to close the tab and leave the meeting.
